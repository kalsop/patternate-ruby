I have 2m of 150cm wide lightweight jersey - show me all the patterns I could make with this.

Make it obvious when there are no results, and a direction on what to do next

Prompt people in to what to search for - you can't always think of the words off the top of your head
Use a taxonomy e.g. neckline: sweetheart, keyhole, scoop
